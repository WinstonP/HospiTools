# HospiTools
This is Chris and Winston's Senior Capstone Project.

HospiTools is an Android mobile app that gives patients and families an easier way to track wait times for hospital visits.  Currently the average wait time to be seen in an emergeny room is 30-90 minutes.  This is problematic for people on a time sensitive schdule and anxious waiting time for family members.  HospiTools gives patients and families access to the hospital's wait time status for medical care.
